# Movie Database Application


A React-based web application that displays a database of movies, allowing users to filter and search through the data.

#### I Decided not utilize any external library for any state management or any UI Component to reduce the bundle size and i saw no need for any external state management library or any UI library

#### Benefits of Building Without External Libraries:

- Deep Understanding
- Forces you to comprehend core React mechanics
- Develops fundamental JavaScript and React skills
- Improves problem-solving capabilities by implementing solutions manually
- No unnecessary library overhead
- Complete control over bundle size
- Precise performance tuning
- Eliminates dependency on third-party code

#### When to Consider External Libraries:
- Project Complexity
- Large-scale applications with complex state management
- Need for rapid development
- Standardized UI/UX requirements
- Team Productivity
- Consistent design systems
- Reduced boilerplate code
- Established patterns and best practices
